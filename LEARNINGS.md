# Project Description
Fabric is a social network designed to help people make new friends in their city who share similar interests. Users can create a profile, search for people in their area, and connect over shared interests.

For this assignment, our functionality is as follows:

1. Sign Up / Log In: Store and authenticate user profile data in Firebase
2. Provide a "Create Profile" form that allows the user to input their name, gender, location, age, and interest (choose among 4 options).
3. View user profile
4. Search for other profiles based on the available data

In the future, we plan to support pairing people based on local events and integrating chat.
